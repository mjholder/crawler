## Signal-based UI/logic separation

**Decision:** Player and Enemy emit signals for game events; UI and game manager connect to those signals externally.
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** Needed an architecture for keeping visual feedback (health bars, combat log) decoupled from game logic (turn order, win/lose conditions).
**Alternatives considered:** Having Player/Enemy directly call UI methods; using a central event bus.
**Rationale:** Signals are Godot's native observer pattern. Emitters don't need references to the UI or game manager — they just fire and let receivers react. All connections live in one place (game.gd), making data flow easy to trace.
**Trade-offs / risks:** Signal connections need to be managed carefully to avoid dangling connections when nodes are freed (use `connect` with `CONNECT_ONE_SHOT` or disconnect on death where needed).
